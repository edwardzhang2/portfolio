  bio: [
    "I like building systems that survive reality: messy inputs, unclear requirements, and someone depending on the output. I’m most comfortable when there are constraints—latency, throughput, data quality, or operational limits—and I have to make tradeoffs explicitly.",
    "Recently that’s meant deploying an OCR + supervised learning pipeline on GPU-backed Kubernetes to digitize 10,000+ handwritten vessel forms, and leading a 10-person Hack4Impact team building a learning platform for an education nonprofit. I care about the decisions behind the code: what to measure, what to automate, and what to keep boring.",
    "Outside of work: health systems and policy rabbit holes, cinema, football/F1, and a cookbook project that keeps expanding its scope."
